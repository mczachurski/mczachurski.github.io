                <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
                <p>
                    By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
                    therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify
                    the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract
                    the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or
                    make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and
                    other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Marcin Czachurski.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marcin Czachurski is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
                    that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any
                    time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                    clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Virtual Coin app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to
                    provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
                    therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing
                    software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It
                    could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
                    security features and it could mean that the Virtual Coin app won’t work properly or at all.

                        The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.

                    You should be aware that there are certain things that Marcin Czachurski will not take
                    responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet
                    connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Marcin
                    Czachurski cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t
                    have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
                    agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
                    your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
                    app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
                    charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
                    region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
                    which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from
                    the bill payer for using the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along the same lines, Marcin Czachurski cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the
                    app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you
                    can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Marcin Czachurski cannot accept responsibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With respect to Marcin Czachurski’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the
                    app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
                    correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
                    it available to you. Marcin Czachurski accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
                    experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the
                    requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the
                    app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app.
                    Marcin Czachurski does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                    and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to
                    always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the
                    app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we
                    tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
                    will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                    periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
                    Conditions on this page.
